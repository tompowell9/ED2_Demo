1. Hello test

2. Hello again


Notes on how to clone and move files between web and laptop.

1. On GitHub website, go to the repository of interest
 -> copy the web address of repository from green "clone" button
 -> Ex. in tompowell/ED2-1 copy from the "clone with HTTPs" 
    (Here, I created a new repository "ED2-Demo")

2. open GitCMD on laptop
 -> go to ('cd') the Git directory on the laptop that holds the repositories.
      C:\Users\TLPowell\Desktop\LBNL_work\GitHub
 -> clone repository from online GitHub repository from step 1.
      type: git clone <HTTPS address from step 1>
      this now clones the online repository to the laptop GitHub directory

3. In the local repository, create a test file: "test.txt"

4. Move "test.txt" to the web repository (Stay in the laptop Git repository)
 -> type: git status 
    This shows all files that have been modified, but the modifications have
    not been tracked.
 -> type: git add <files to commit>  (in this case test.txt)
    This step only makes a list of the files that have been modified that 
    I want to commit.
 -> type: git commit -m "new test file"
    This step commits the modifications of each file in the add step to the local
    record and makes local a version of the files that I am working on.
 -> type: git status
    should show that the working tree is clean
 -> type: git push
    This moves the local files that I have created or modified to my 
    web-based repository.

clone the web-based repository
